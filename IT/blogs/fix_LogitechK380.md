# Fix: Logitech K380 Keyboard Key Problem
## Problem
My Logitech K380 Keyboard left 'shift' key cannot bounce back. The key does response but the pressing on button does not give a proper feedback. When pressing the button, it feels like knocking on a firm table, which hurts my finger and very unconfortable.

## Fixing

### 1. Open up the button.
The button is connected with two metal lever stickes and two plastic scissor structures with lots of small, vulnerable plastic buckles. So, take off the button carefully.

To do so, use two hard thin metal sticks to open up the gap between the cap and the base. Gentaly round the cap with the sticks to separate the buckles.

You can use one stick to hold the metal lever sticks and the other stick to open up the cap to disconnect the buckles.

### 2. Check the components statutes.
Once the cap of the button is successfully removed, check if any of the buckles is damaged. If so, buy a new keyboard.

If the buckles are fine, check whether the metal balance stickes are too loose. The loosing balance lever sticks could lead to unstable button activities. In my case, I bend one of the balance sticks to ensure it hook on the base tightly.


Remember the location, order and direction of the black scissor structures. Some quick sketch or photo will help.

### 3. Re-install the components.

Clean the base of the button.

Hook the two balance lever sticks on the base and make sure they lies at the up and down side of the button naturally. A bit loose is okay because these balance lever sticks are easy to click into the buckles on the cap.

Place the scissor structures on the base correctly. If the scissor is hooked or clicked on the cap, remove it from cap carefully. The scissor structure should has one side hooked on the cap and another side clicked on a pair of buckles of the cap. Remove them carefully. The scissor structures should be clicked on the buckles of the base.

Install the cap. Connect the scissor structures first. The lower side of the scissor structures are hooked to the cap while the upper side is click onto the cap. Therefore, lower the angle of the cap and hook the lower side first. Then press the upper side to click the buckles.

Finally, use thin hard metal sticks to adjust the position of balance lever sticks through the gap of the cap and the base. Then, press the cap to click the buckles and connect the balance lever sticks and the cap.

### 4. Some pictures.
When open up, one of the balance lever sticks is loose, and one of the scissor structure is loose from the base.
