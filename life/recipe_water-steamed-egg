### 4. Cover the bowl with cling film and steam it for around 15 minutes.

+ Time is very important!
+ The Perfect timing is when the eggs in the bowl is mostly solid and a little bit watery.
+ 15 minutes is measured when the water in the pot is boiled.
+ Time could change depending on the number of eggs and the frequency you open the lid to check the eggs.
+ Do not steam for too short: other wise the egg wont be firm enough. But sometimes it is too watery due to the wrong water-egg ratio.
+ Do not steam for too long: the egg will turns to green and black, which is bad.
+ You could check the egg status during steaming by gentally shake the bowl. Be careful with the hot steam!

### 6. Add light soy sause and goose fat/sunflower oil

+ One teaspoon soy sause (1-2 ml)
+ One teaspoon goose fat/sunflower oil

The soy sause is salty so do not put too much. You could add extra soy sause while eating anyway.

The goose fat or sunflower oil can cover the unpleasent smell of eggs.

See appendix for how to choose good soy sause and how to tell the different from different kinds of soy sause.

The finished dish looks like this:

### 7. Final tip: wash the bowl immediatly once finished and do not soak it even if you have a wash machine. Otherwise it will be very difficult to clean.

## Appendix - Soy sause:

### Distinguish

There are basically two types of soy sauses: dark soy sause and light soy sause.

Dark (left) and light (right)

<img src="./img_recipe_water-steamed-egg/IMG_0724.JPEG" width="40%">.

The dark soy sause looks like sticky ink, and the light soy sause is, well, lighter.

There are soy sauses with extra flavor such as mushroom. Do not use those unless you are 100% sure what you are doing.

### Differences

1. The light soy sause could go without cooking (such as adding it onto the eggs), but you must cook the dark soy sause. So the table soy sause you find in Japan resterant and sushi box is light soy sause.

2. The light soy sause is more salty then dark soy sause. The dary soy sause is actually a little bit sweet.

3. The dark soy sause is used mostly for its color, while the light soy sause is used for its taste.

### Good soy sause

Buy the expensice one, or:

Check the label on the bottle.
The good soy sause should have less salt, less or no flavour enhancer.
